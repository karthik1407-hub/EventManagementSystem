# Optimization Plan for AdminComponent

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Define entity configurations for API endpoints, form fields, and ID mappings
- [ ] Refactor state signals to use Maps for data and counts
- [ ] Create generic methods for form operations (showAddForm, showEditForm, hideForm, saveForm)
- [ ] Refactor loadSectionData to use configurations
- [ ] Update ngOnInit and other methods to use generic approaches
- [ ] Remove all repetitive entity-specific form methods
- [ ] Test the optimized component for functionality
