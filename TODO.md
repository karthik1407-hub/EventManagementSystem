# Admin Panel Enhancement TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update Feedback interface in admin.component.ts to include userEmail, eventName, eventID, userID
- [x] Add counts to section headers in admin.component.html (Users, Feedback, Notifications, Tickets, Events)
- [x] Update feedback display to show user and event details

## Summary

# Admin Dashboard UI Enhancement

## Steps
- [ ] Update CSS variables for mild pastel color palette (soft blues, grays, greens for calm professional feel)
- [ ] Enhance .admin-container with subtle gradient background, improved spacing, and base transitions
- [ ] Refine .admin-section: Add unique subtle wave-like bottom border via pseudo-element, enhance hover with scale/shadow transitions
- [ ] Update .section-header: Milder gradient, replace text toggle with CSS chevron icon, smooth rotation transition
- [ ] Improve button styles (.add-btn, .edit-btn, .delete-btn, etc.): Mild colors (add: soft green, edit: soft orange, delete: soft red), add ripple effect on click with transition
- [ ] Update .data-item: Subtle alternating row backgrounds, improved typography with hover line-height transition
- [ ] Enhance modal: Backdrop blur transition, content slide-in animation
- [ ] Add global transitions/animations: 0.3s ease-in-out for all interactive elements; slideDown for .section-content expansion
- [ ] Verify responsiveness and test locally (ng serve, browser check)
