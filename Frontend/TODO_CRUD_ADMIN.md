# TODO: Implement Full CRUD Operations in Admin Panel

## Overview
The admin panel currently supports listing (Read) and deleting items, but Create and Update operations navigate to separate components. The goal is to implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) inline within the admin panel for better user experience.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Read**: All entities are listed in the admin panel
- ✅ **Delete**: Delete functionality with confirmation modal exists
- ❌ **Create**: Currently navigates to separate components
- ❌ **Update**: Currently navigates to separate components

## Entities to Implement CRUD For
1. **Users** - Full CRUD needed
2. **Feedback** - Full CRUD needed
3. **Notifications** - Full CRUD needed
4. **Tickets** - Full CRUD needed
5. **Events** - Create/Update partially implemented (navigates), Delete works
6. **Payments** - Full CRUD needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Verification ✅
- [x] Verify all controllers support full CRUD operations
- [x] Confirm DTOs are properly defined
- [x] Check API endpoints are functional

### Phase 2: Frontend Infrastructure
- [ ] Add ReactiveFormsModule to admin component
- [ ] Create form interfaces for each entity
- [ ] Add form state management to admin component
- [ ] Implement modal/expandable forms for create/edit

### Phase 3: User CRUD Implementation
- [ ] Add create user form to admin panel
- [ ] Add edit user form to admin panel
- [ ] Implement user form validation
- [ ] Add user create/edit API calls
- [ ] Update user list after create/edit

### Phase 4: Feedback CRUD Implementation
- [ ] Add create feedback form to admin panel
- [ ] Add edit feedback form to admin panel
- [ ] Implement feedback form validation
- [ ] Add feedback create/edit API calls
- [ ] Update feedback list after create/edit

### Phase 5: Notification CRUD Implementation
- [ ] Add create notification form to admin panel
- [ ] Add edit notification form to admin panel
- [ ] Implement notification form validation
- [ ] Add notification create/edit API calls
- [ ] Update notification list after create/edit

### Phase 6: Ticket CRUD Implementation
- [ ] Add create ticket form to admin panel
- [ ] Add edit ticket form to admin panel
- [ ] Implement ticket form validation
- [ ] Add ticket create/edit API calls
- [ ] Update ticket list after create/edit

### Phase 7: Payment CRUD Implementation
- [ ] Add create payment form to admin panel
- [ ] Add edit payment form to admin panel (if supported by backend)
- [ ] Implement payment form validation
- [ ] Add payment create/edit API calls
- [ ] Update payment list after create/edit

### Phase 8: Event CRUD Enhancement
- [ ] Replace navigation with inline create form
- [ ] Replace navigation with inline edit form
- [ ] Maintain existing delete functionality

### Phase 9: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add loading states for all operations
- [ ] Add success/error messages
- [ ] Implement form reset after operations
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Ensure responsive design

### Phase 10: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations for each entity
- [ ] Verify form validation works correctly
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify admin role restrictions
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets

## Technical Considerations
- Use Angular Reactive Forms for complex validation
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all DTOs
- Maintain signal-based state management
- Add proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensure consistent UI patterns across all forms
- Consider implementing generic CRUD components to reduce code duplication

## Dependencies
- Backend APIs must be fully functional
- Admin authentication/authorization must be working
- ReactiveFormsModule must be available
- HTTP client must be configured

## Success Criteria
- All CRUD operations work inline within admin panel
- No navigation required for create/edit operations
- Consistent user experience across all entities
- Proper validation and error handling
- Responsive design maintained
- Performance acceptable with large datasets
